# Valid Palindrome

## Description

Given a string `s`, determine if it is a palindrome, considering **only alphanumeric characters** and **ignoring case**.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

### Examples

```ts
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: After removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase, it becomes "amanaplanacanalpanama".

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
```
