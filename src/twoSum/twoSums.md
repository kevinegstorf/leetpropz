# Two Sum Problem

The **Two Sum** problem is a classic algorithmic challenge where the goal is to find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

### Constraints

- Each input has **exactly one solution**.
- You may not use the same element twice.
- The solution must return the indices in any order.

### Example

#### Input:

```plaintext
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
```
